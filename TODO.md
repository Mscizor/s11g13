##### Phase 2:
> Node, Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB

>For this phase, you are required to submit a Node.js project that can be connected to locally by accessing localhost:3000. Architecture needs not to implement MVC yet but highly encouraged. For encouragement, MP Phase 3 is required to be in MVC.

##### Model

- All database related files should be in the model folder.

##### View
- All views must be visible and can be navigated to from the first page.
- All forms must use the appropriate HTTP methods (i.e. Login forms use POST, search queries use GET, etc).
- All views are expected to be in the views folder. Convert files to handlebars/ejs/pug files as necessary.

###### Controller

- Using third party database servers such as mlab is allowed. 
- The use of different server scripts and database is allowed, like the Node.js version of Firestore.
