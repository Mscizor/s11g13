# Contributing

## Greetings!

Unfortunately, due to the nature of this project, we are not allowing others to contribute to this project.

Despite this, we are open to any suggestions you have so we may be able to improve the site (that is, if we decide to work on this in the future).

## Reporting bugs and opening suggestions

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Contact us through our email or through the link in the README under Authors.

> To determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself the following:
>
> - Can I access something that's not mine?
> - Can I have access to something I shouln't have access to?
> - Can I manipulate someone else's account?
>
> If you answer "yes" to any of those, that may definitely be a security issue.

Reporting any misspellings and other UI errors is greatly appreciated. If you think there is a better way to design our app, hit us up!
